# Deep Learning Methods in Automatic Nuclei Detection in Microscopy
This project was based on the Data Science Bowl 2018 for Kaggle. The paper was written for my Computer Vision class. (Mask R-CNN implementation is based on Matteport's Mask R-CNN implmentation in Keras with added preprocessing and configs that extend the model.)
